Anyway, claw game machines are rigged. The vast majority of models are computerized and include a variety of programmable settings, including a Win/Lose Ratio. This ratio is enforced by the Two-Stage Claw Power setting, which lets the claw grip at a certain strength, then slide to a weaker setting, to give the illusion of the prize slipping out of the claw. This ratio can also be enforced with a Failure Rate, a second setting that causes the machine to shut down if it dispenses too many prizes in a certain time frame. Most models have a factory default setting of one win to twelve loses.  
  
In other examples, Sega has a machine called Key Master, where you use the levers to move the key up and down, with the goal being to get it into the socket and 'unlock' the prize. This machine's Win/Lose Ratio is enforced by the Vertical Deviation setting, which causes it to stop at specific spots slightly off-set from the sockets. This Vertical Deviation is set by half-centimeters.

Compared to claw game machines, the default win/lose ratio is 1:700. Holy *crap*."

It also doesn't matter if H2O comes from inside or outside of the body, either - H2O is H2O, if the molecular structure of composition changed, then it wouldn't be water (H2O2, for example, is hydrogen peroxide). "

You all know what a googol is, a 1 followed by 100 zeros.

Now there is such a monstrous number called a googolplex, a 1 followed by a googol zeros! 

I'll put it in another perspective:
To write a googolplex as a number, taking into account the speed of which the average human writes at, will take 1.51x10^92 years.

Thats 15100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 years to write that goddamn behemoth of a number! 

Still not sinking in? 

Ok

Just put it this way, if the universe had a googolplex number of atoms (which it doesn't, by a long way!), it would be statistically impossible for there NOT to be a exact copy of you, atom by atom, in the universe, at least 1! 

We don't know how big the universe is, we can see 90 billion lightyears away to the observable edge of the universe, we can't see further becuase light hasnt had enough time, since the big bang,  to reach us. It could be a googolplex large. But we will never know. Nor will your identical copy.

5vm14k,328 Words that are different in England than America,43,19,"I've been compiling this for years.  May as well share it.  One or two of them are just different pronounciations too.  I've kept this pretty much to myself and and American friend who I've pestered with questions over the years, so feedback and contextual corrections are welcome.  I suppose this is mainly aimed at Americans for two reasons: Brits know most Americanisms already via mass American media, and this project began as a pretty small list for one person.  The list does include a few equivalents, ie 999 instead of 911.


There are a few spelling differences which I haven't mentioned since the list would be gigabytes long, such as we (England) write -ize suffix as -ise, and Americans omit the ""u"" in the -our suffix, eg. ""colour"".


One more thing worth mentioning is that both parties have unnecessarily strange terms for simple things, so one party isn't more ""correct"" than the other.  For example, jungle-gym is a weird name for a climbing frame, but dodge'em is a weird name for a bumper car.

3mrswx,As a nurse it seems patients are unaware as to why you don't eat after the midnight before surgery. Here's why,26,3,"If a person is to recieve general anesthesia the anesthesiologist will intubate the patient for the procedure. Intubation is a tube that is inserted into the mouth down the throat and into the trachea. This procedure is done so a patient can breathe during surgery. As the anesthesia causes you to have an unstable airway. 

When you are under you have no control over your gag reflex. If you have just recently eaten (a few hours) you are at a very high risk of vomiting while this tube is placed. Causing aspiration and possibly getting vomit contents into your lungs. This can be life threatening. It also has the more long term risk of aspiration pneumonia. 

So when your nurse tells you that you are NPO before surgery. Please don't sneak food.  It's really for your safety.

If the earth had always had 7 billion people and everyone had shuffled a deck of cards every SECOND (the earth is about 1.433e17 seconds old). That would give something of 1.0e27 sequences (assuming no repetition occurs, but let's be honest, the chance of repetition is smaller than 1.0e-38%).

Okay, so, more numbers to blow you away: it is said that there are around 1e12 or something stars in the our galaxy and again 1e12 galaxies in the universe (These are really rough numbers though).
This means that there have to be 1e16 different universes (about the same amount Marvel has).

To put things even more in perspective: there are like 7.5e18 grains of sand on earth (very rough estimate).

Tl;dr: presumed that there is no recurrence, if every grain of sand was a universe like ours, if every star in every galaxy would have been an earth, every earth existed as long as our earth, every earth had 7 billion people since second 1 and everyone on every earth had shuffled a deck of cards every second.

azamlv,Tried doing napkin math if burning all the world's oil increased global temperature independent of the greenhouse gas effect,6,0,"Was going to post a question to /r/AskScience about alternative hypotheses to climate change but disproved my own idea, not sure where else to put it so I'll put it here in case! Maybe this could be a fun fact. To oversimplify everything and use a ton of unwritten assumptions, here's napkin math:

* Per google unit converter, one barrel of oil stores 6.118e+9 joules of energy

* Per [this source}(https://www.statista.com/statistics/271823/daily-global-crude-oil-demand-since-2006/) (credibility unknown), global oil production is 99 million barrels per day, which is 36.135 billion barrels per year

* Multiply these two numbers to arrive at 2.21068986732e+20 joules of energy acquired worldwide per year

* The ocean weighs 1.45e+18 tons per [this source](http://see-the-sea.org/facts/facts-body.htm)

Therefore using [this calculator](https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/specific-heat), if all of the worlds global oil production exclusively burned to heat the earth's ocean (the simplest way I could think to quantify global temperature), the change in temperature of the worlds ocean only increases by 0.0000401932°C.

Therefore, I think I gave it a best-case scenario and conclude under no circumstances will purely the heat energy released by burning oil have a noticeable effect on global temperature.

By extension, I'm guessing that any energy consumption by other stored chemical sources (natural gas, coal) do not match the energy output of oil, but even if they did, these 3 altogether will also not have a noticeable effect unless natural gas energy output is about 1,000 to 10,000 times higher than that of oil.

Anyway, just thought this was interesting."

>The Beatles and the Rolling Stones ruled England, and at Copford Glebe, Salem’s friends formed “The Echoes” to chase their own rock-and-roll dreams. There was some genuine talent in the group—Rupert Armitage later became an accomplished classical guitarist, and another member, Paul Kennerley, would enjoy success as a singer-songwriter-producer and marry the multitalented Emmylou Harris. Salem was never a formal band member, as he did not have that sort of ability, but he played the harmonica at jam sessions and begged for guitar lessons. He did not have the patience for sustained study, however. He just wanted to rock.

On March 31, 1950, a city called Hot Springs held an election on whether to rename itself to Truth or Consequences. The town voted and passed the name change with votes of 1294 to 295 and the town renamed itself. The next day, April 1, Edwards and his wife, along with the staff, flew to Hot Springs (now Truth or Consequences) New Mexico to record the tenth-anniversary broadcast of Truth or Consequences. You can also find it on a map.

Given how 0855-0714's distance has a margin of error of 0.13 light-years, this means that any observer on the star or on a planet around it would detect the signal anywhere from September 1 and November 5.

Also note that because of the sheer amount of Wi-Fi output Earth would be going through would make it very difficult to detect the signal and thus the program, even though at that distance the program would be relatively high-quality when using something as small as the SKA or that black hole imaging array."

We had just gone back to our cabin to take quick showers, and I realized something. Myself, my husband, and my mother in law all showered using a generic brand of flowery scented bodywash. However, my father in law used Irish Spring. So that was the answer! I had never even considered using it because it is typically marketed towards men, and I'm not a huge fan of the scent.

THE CURE TO PREVENTING MOSQUITOS IS IRISH SPRING!

We all tried it the next time and none of us were bothered by the bugs! Since then I have been showering with Irish Spring bodywash or soap and have not been bitten once by a bug!

Who would have known that this simple product was the cure to all of our itches. For anyone who is looking to prevent bug bites, seriously bath in Irish Spring. "

7ao9ho,Fun Fact: The largest number most programs might handle is about 41373247548 digits.,7,0,"Almost all programs are written in languages that have a max limit for integers of [2^63 -1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9,223,372,036,854,775,807), and we can reach [2^64 -1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_(computer_science)) if we make sure it's positive. That's 18446744073709551614, which is 20 digits. Some languages have built-in arbitrary precision number systems that are based on string representations (meaning the number is stored as text). Unfortunately, these languages generally have a [string length limit](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12088463/5299034) of [2^31 -1](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html#MAX_VALUE), meaning that's the largest number of digits we can get.(*) That's really cool, and can give us 2147483647 digits.

Then comes GMP. GMP is also useable in most programming languages, and [some use them by default](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Multiple_Precision_Arithmetic_Library#/Language_bindings), such as Haskell. You can't have a whole number larger than [2^37 -64 bits](https://gmplib.org/list-archives/gmp-discuss/2012-March/004948.html) (that's over [17GB](https://www.google.com/search?q=137438953408+bits+to+gb) to hold the one number). So, that value as an actual number is 2^137438953408. Unfortunately, I don't have 17GB RAM on my laptop, so I can't calculate it. It's also a little frustrating, because it would only take about [37 calculations to solve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring), so it'd be done in milliseconds. Fortunately, we have the change of base formula. We know can calculate that 2^137438953408 is approximately 10^41373247548.47235.

Therefore, although I didn't learn what that number was, we know it's about 41373247548 digits. The number of digits is 11 digits long.

73pkr3,Fun Fact: Octopuses have 9 brains...,16,10,"...*sort of*.  Technically, they have 1 brain and eight ""nerve clusters"".  But since nerve clusters are just underdeveloped brains, and the ones in octopuses are especially well developed, it's safe and easier to say 9 brains (it also sounds cooler).  
These nerve clusters are are so well developed that they can function completely separately from one another, but they work together to perform tasks.  
In fact, if an arm get's severed and the nerve cluster is still attached to the arm, that arm will go out and do its' own thing completely separate from the body until the arm runs out of blood.  "

larrys father (so larry is the first) has 5 kids. 10 (which is the second) 20 (the third) 30 (the 4th) and 40 which is actually the 5th. so fun fact, 40 is the 5th kid.

in german we also say ""lele lala lolo lili and?"" cause it sounds more like names instead of just numbers."

6kjjpe,Flushing F.U.N,7,3,"Do you what to demolish an entire building by just flushing a toilet? Follow these three easy steps and enjoy the fun! 

1st - you will need to find a building, or any kind of facility, that has a minimum of 100 toilets.

2nd - gather people up and assign them each a toilet to flush. 

But don't let them flush just yet, there's one more step!

3rd - set up a time where everyone has to flush, at set time, then BOOM! The building will shatter internally!!! 

This may be a bit tricky for some but here are some tips on how to successfully demolish a building by flushing. 

- have the people synchronize their clocks in order to flush simultaneously

- use hand held radios to each one (or have everyone use the same radio frequency) then have a count down to when everyone will flush 

- make sure to find every single toilet that the facility may have or else this will not work

 ***IT HAS TO BE EVERY TOILET OR IT WILL NOT WORK*** 

Just follow these steps and FLUSH FLUSH FLUSH! "

6j3jsg,A Unique key making process in 3d Printing,0,1,"UrbanAlps, a Swiss Company, has made huge changes in the key design process through 3D printing. Highly skilled intruders are often known for duplicating keys to gain entry into a property and steal important valuables. Since 3D scanner and 3D printer are widely available these days, forging a regular key is so easy. But with the advancement of technology, the Steal Key makes it a little difficult to duplicate a key as it hides its internal coding through a solid layer. 

The Stealth Key is made with a metal 3D printer that melts together with other layers of titanium, potentially producing five million combinations. With its teeth concealed under narrow ledges, the key is almost unforgeable. 
UrbanAlps believes that the key does not avert any activities of burglaries, as there is no such a thing. However, the company positions their product as a safer alternative of preventing ex-employee, tenants, or partners from gaining access to the property. The cylinders of Stealth Key are well-matched with any profiles of European cylinder locks.

The company is presently looking for customers who can initially attest the product. They provide an offer of cylinder having two sets of keys for EUR 200, particularly for order of more than 300 units. Nevertheless, individual customers who find interest in high security systems can make a pre-order on the Stealth padlock having a shrouded shackle and an excellent alloy housing that repel liquid nitrogen attacks.
